This watchapp uses PebbleKit JS to fetch weather data from the
[openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/) and display it on the watch.
It uses the location provided by the phone to look up the nearest location, and
sends temperature data along with that location's name. A weather icon is also
displayed.
